# AsposeSandbox

This is a repository for playing with Aspose in an isolated environment. It is a simple console application with the versions of Aspose libraries that we are currently using as of 3/13/2018. If you need to upgrade versions, it is easy enough to do so using NuGet. You might find this valuable if you can reproduce a problem and then see if the latest Aspose libraries will fix it.
